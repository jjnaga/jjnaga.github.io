QuickNote is a script made in Python. While the app itself isn't to complicated, I used this experieince to learn greatly about Terminal and how Unix Operating Systems worked. 

I went into this project with the goal of learning how to use the Terminal effectively. I also saw that black box as something that only hackers use, but as I learned more and more about Terminal, and by extension, Unix, I fell in love with it. 

This project was to help me gain knowledge for ICS 215, which was a Scripting class. I wanted a quick way to take notes using the Terminal. The hardest part for me I think was learning about scripts in general. The actual code isn't to complex, Python makes it very easy to append text to an existing file. The tricky part is getting the program to work just by calling it. I had to learn how paths work in the Terminal, and it completely opened my eyes to the possibilities of Terminal.

From this experience, I learned a great deal, and hope to expand my knowledge by creating a script that is incredibly useful.
